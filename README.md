# chicken-egg-oop
Java object-oriented programming code challenge.
Example of Java applying interface, class inheritance and sending a function as an argument. This project was done without Java 8, 
Libs, Frameworks or anything like that.

# Code Challenge Requirements
 - Chicken lays an egg that hatches into other chicken.
 - Eggs from other types of birds should hatch into that type of bird; in other words, other birds don't make chickens.
 - Hatching an egg for the second time throws a IllegalStateException; in other words, Eggs can't hatch twice.
